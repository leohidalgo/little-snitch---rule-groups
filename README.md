This repo provide rule groups for Little Snitch based on unified host list to block ads, malware, fake news and porn.

Scripts will convert the unified host files provided and maintained by the great team and members at https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts to the .lsrules files which can be directly subscribed in Little Snitch.
